A GIS map of what ward Chi Hack Night attendees said they live in. Collected on Feb 2, 2016.

During the announcements of a Chi Hack Night meetup in 2016, each person said their name and which ward they live in. We made a tally of this and then Steven Vance quickly made a map by adding a column to the city's wards shapefile.
